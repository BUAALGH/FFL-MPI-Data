## 🏗 FFL-MPI-Data Construction Workflow

The construction of the FFL-MPI-Data involves careful processing from raw signal acquisition (measured) or Langevin modeling (simulated) to the final sinogram and image domains.

## 🛠 Code Usage and Functionality

This project provides example codes for loading and processing the dataset.

### 1. `reconstruction_codes`: Signal Processing and Image Reconstruction Example Codes

This module contains scripts that demonstrate loading the dataset and performing basic reconstruction using traditional FBP methods across different data domains.

| **Script Name**        | **Data Domain**   | **Dataset Type** | **Key Procedures**                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `measured_sensor`        | Sensor Domain (Voltage) | Measured               | Reading Voltage Signals, STFT Processing, FBP |
| `measured_sinogram`      | Sinogram Domain         | Measured               | Reading Sinograms, FBP-based Reconstruction   |
| `simulated_sinogram`     | Sinogram Domain         | Simulated              | Reading Sinograms, FBP-based Reconstruction   |

If the user is processing voltage signals from the measured dataset, use `measured_sensor.m`;  
if processing sinograms from the measured dataset, use `measured_sinogram.m`;  
if processing sinograms from the simulated dataset, use `simulated_sinogram.m`.  

The user only needs to modify their own data storage path to complete the image reconstruction.  
Our sample code provides a single-data processing method. If batch data processing is required, simply add an additional loop for handling.

The method for reading **.h5**__ files is as follows (the example code was written in **MATLAB**__; users may modify it according to their own environment):

To read the metadata of an .h5 file, use the following code:

`h5readatt(filepath, ‘/’,'Phantom_number')`

To read the imaginary component image of an .h5 file's image domain, use the following code:

`data = h5read(filepath, ‘/data/image/imag’);`

To read the imaginary component data of the sinogram domain from an h5 file, use the following code:

`data = h5read(filepath, ‘/data/sinogram/imag’);`

_filepath_ represents the address of your file.


### 2. `simulation_tool`:open-sourced simulation framework codes

This module provides the calibrated MPI simulation framework used to generate large-scale synthetic datasets. We provide 3 sample phantoms, including vascular phantoms and an "S" letter phantom, which users can directly call for demonstration.

**Components of the Simulation Tool:**
##### 1. Dataset
- **Source**: MNIST dataset is employed as the digital phantom source.
- **Split**: 60,000 samples for training and 10,000 samples for testing.

##### 2. Models
- **Implemented Model**: The framework currently includes the **Langevin Model** for magnetic particle modeling.
- **Extensibility**: Additional particle models can be incorporated by adding corresponding files to the `Models` folder. To use a new model, update the model index in `Modules/Basic_setups.m`.

##### 3. Noise
- **Availability**: Background noise files (`noise_k_2.mat` to `noise_k_7.mat`) are provided.
- **Specifications**: 
  - The noise is defined in the image domain.
  - Each noise sample has a size of `[49, 49]`.
  - It is added directly onto the simulated images.

##### 4. Modules
The simulation framework is organized into the following modular components:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Basic_setups.m` | Configures fundamental parameters, including: <br> • Gradient strength <br> • Excitation magnetic field amplitude <br> • ADC sampling specifications <br> • Nanoparticle type selection |
| `Magnetic_Field_Generation.m` | Generates the magnetic field required for imaging based on the configurations set in `Basic_setups.m`. |
| `Phantoms_Load.m` | Loads digital images (e.g., from MNIST) for use as simulation phantoms. |
| `Signal_Generation.m` | Computes nanoparticle magnetization-induced signals based on the selected particle model (e.g., modified Jiles–Atherton) and the generated magnetic field. |
| `visualization.m` | Visualizes imaging results, including sinograms and reconstructed images. |

##### 5. Main Function
- **File**: `main_function.m`
- **Purpose**: Contains the main simulation pipeline.
- **Usage**: Execute `main_function.m` to run the complete simulation process.

**Running Results:**
<img width="1920" height="954" alt="Output" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6320c364-747c-46aa-b32b-6a11c8fcba40" />
Users can add `save img_simulated_imag.mat img_simulated_imag` to save the output image. 

Similarly, we provide single-image sample code. If users need to run large-scale MNIST data, they can:

1. In `Phantom_Load.m`, **delete or comment out**:
   - Line 14: `load phantom.mat % loading the example phantom`
   - Line 15: `train_images = phantom; % change the data type of phantom, if you have multiple phantoms`

2. **Add**:
   ```matlab
   img_imag_synomag_2nd(:,:,n) = img_simulated_imag;
   save img_imag_synomag_2nd.mat img_imag_synomag_2nd
to create and save batch data.

3. Additionally, in `main_function.m`, modify this line:
   `N_phantoms = 1; % Number of phantoms to process`

Set the number to define how many MNIST data samples to run.

## 3. `deep_learning_demo`

To demonstrate the dataset's utility in deep learning-based reconstruction, we have developed and open-sourced a demo featuring two representative projection imaging challenges.

#### Reconstruction Scenarios

| Challenge Type | rotation angles | angle numbers |
| :------------: | :----------: | :---------------: |

| Limited-angle Reconstruction | 0°:3°:90° | 31 angles |
| Sparse-view Reconstruction | 0°:12°:180° | 16 angles |

#### Network Architecture

**FBPConvNet Architecture** - A U-Net variant with Filtered Back Projection (FBP) integration, specifically tailored for image reconstruction tasks.

#### Training Configuration

| Parameter | Pre-training Phase | Fine-tuning Phase |
| :-------: | :----------------: | :---------------: |
| Dataset | 10,000 simulated phantoms | 80 measured phantoms (training) + 20 (validation) |
| Epochs | 200 | 200 |
| Optimizer | Adam | Adam |
| Learning Rate | 10⁻⁴ | 10⁻⁵ |
| Loss Function | PSNR loss | PSNR loss |
| Batch Size | 8 | 8 |
| GPU | NVIDIA RTX 4090 | NVIDIA RTX 4090 |
